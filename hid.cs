
//NOTE 2: This C# program makes use of several functions in setupapi.dll and
//other Win32 DLLs.  However, one cannot call the functions directly in a 
//32-bit DLL if the project is built in "Any CPU" mode, when run on a 64-bit OS.
//When configured to build an "Any CPU" executable, the executable will "become"
//a 64-bit executable when run on a 64-bit OS.  On a 32-bit OS, it will run as 
//a 32-bit executable, and the pointer sizes and other aspects of this 
//application will be compatible with calling 32-bit DLLs.

//Therefore, on a 64-bit OS, this application will not work unless it is built in
//"x86" mode.  When built in this mode, the exectuable always runs in 32-bit mode
//even on a 64-bit OS.  This allows this application to make 32-bit DLL function 
//calls, when run on either a 32-bit or 64-bit OS.

//By default, on a new project, C# normally wants to build in "Any CPU" mode.  
//To switch to "x86" mode, open the "Configuration Manager" window.  In the 
//"Active solution platform:" drop down box, select "x86".  If this option does
//not appear, select: "<New...>" and then select the x86 option in the 
//"Type or select the new platform:" drop down box.

		    Before we can "connect" our application to our USB embedded device, we must first find the device.
		    A USB bus can have many devices simultaneously connected, so somehow we have to find our device only.
		    This is done with the Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID).  Each USB product line should have
		    a unique combination of VID and PID.  

		    Microsoft has created a number of functions which are useful for finding plug and play devices.  Documentation
		    for each function used can be found in the MSDN library.  We will be using the following functions (unmanaged C functions):

		    SetupDiGetClassDevs()					//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    GetLastError()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows
		    SetupDiDestroyDeviceInfoList()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    SetupDiGetDeviceRegistryProperty()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    CreateFile()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows

            In order to call these unmanaged functions, the Marshal class is very useful.
             
		    We will also be using the following unusual data types and structures.  Documentation can also be found in
		    the MSDN library:

		    PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DATA
		    PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA
		    SP_DEVINFO_DATA
		    HDEVINFO
		    HANDLE
		    GUID

		    The ultimate objective of the following code is to get the device path, which will be used elsewhere for getting
		    read and write handles to the USB device.  Once the read/write handles are opened, only then can this
		    PC application begin reading/writing to the USB device using the WriteFile() and ReadFile() functions.

		    Getting the device path is a multi-step round about process, which requires calling several of the
		    SetupDixxx() functions provided by setupapi.dll.

		    Before we can "connect" our application to our USB embedded device, we must first find the device.
		    A USB bus can have many devices simultaneously connected, so somehow we have to find our device only.
		    This is done with the Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID).  Each USB product line should have
		    a unique combination of VID and PID.  

		    Microsoft has created a number of functions which are useful for finding plug and play devices.  Documentation
		    for each function used can be found in the MSDN library.  We will be using the following functions (unmanaged C functions):

		    SetupDiGetClassDevs()					//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    GetLastError()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows
		    SetupDiDestroyDeviceInfoList()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    SetupDiGetDeviceRegistryProperty()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		    CreateFile()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows

            In order to call these unmanaged functions, the Marshal class is very useful.
             
		    We will also be using the following unusual data types and structures.  Documentation can also be found in
		    the MSDN library:

		    PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DATA
		    PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA
		    SP_DEVINFO_DATA
		    HDEVINFO
		    HANDLE
		    GUID

		    The ultimate objective of the following code is to get the device path, which will be used elsewhere for getting
		    read and write handles to the USB device.  Once the read/write handles are opened, only then can this
		    PC application begin reading/writing to the USB device using the WriteFile() and ReadFile() functions.

		    Getting the device path is a multi-step round about process, which requires calling several of the
		    SetupDixxx() functions provided by setupapi.dll.

            /*This thread does the actual USB read/write operations (but only when AttachedState == true) to the USB device.
            It is generally preferrable to write applications so that read and write operations are handled in a separate
            thread from the main form.  This makes it so that the main form can remain responsive, even if the I/O operations
            take a very long time to complete.

            Since this is a separate thread, this code below executes independently from the rest of the
            code in this application.  All this thread does is read and write to the USB device.  It does not update
            the form directly with the new information it obtains (such as the ANxx/POT Voltage or pushbutton state).
            The information that this thread obtains is stored in atomic global variables.
            Form updates are handled by the FormUpdateTimer Tick event handler function.

            This application sends packets to the endpoint buffer on the USB device by using the "WriteFile()" function.
            This application receives packets from the endpoint buffer on the USB device by using the "ReadFile()" function.
            Both of these functions are documented in the MSDN library.  Calling ReadFile() is a not perfectly straight
            foward in C# environment, since one of the input parameters is a pointer to a buffer that gets filled by ReadFile().
            The ReadFile() function is therefore called through a wrapper function ReadFileManagedBuffer().

            All ReadFile() and WriteFile() operations in this example project are synchronous.  They are blocking function
            calls and only return when they are complete, or if they fail because of some event, such as the user unplugging
            the device.  It is possible to call these functions with "overlapped" structures, and use them as non-blocking
            asynchronous I/O function calls.  

            Note:  This code may perform differently on some machines when the USB device is plugged into the host through a
            USB 2.0 hub, as opposed to a direct connection to a root port on the PC.  In some cases the data rate may be slower
            when the device is connected through a USB 2.0 hub.  This performance difference is believed to be caused by
            the issue described in Microsoft knowledge base article 940021:
            http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940021/en-us 

            Higher effective bandwidth (up to the maximum offered by interrupt endpoints), both when connected
            directly and through a USB 2.0 hub, can generally be achieved by queuing up multiple pending read and/or
            write requests simultaneously.  This can be done when using	asynchronous I/O operations (calling ReadFile() and
            WriteFile()	with overlapped structures).  The Microchip	HID USB Bootloader application uses asynchronous I/O
            for some USB operations and the source code can be used	as an example.*/
